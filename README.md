## MorphoHub has the following components:
1. MorphoHub_DBMS:
    - Multi-level data generation and workflow management.
    - Version control of morphometry data.
    - Screen wall-based data visualization and monitoring.
    - User management.
2. L0Generator:
    - Generation of L0 data based on neuron skeletons.
3. DendriteGenerator:
    - Parallel generation of dendrites.
4. BoutonGenerator:(L3 data)
    - Mass generation of synaptic boutons.
